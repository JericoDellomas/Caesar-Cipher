# Caesar-Cipher




ðŸ“ŒIn order to run a Python program in the terminal using VSCode, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once you have Python installed, navigate to the directory where the program is located using the terminal. Once you are in the directory containing the program, you can run the program by typing "python" followed by the name of the Python file. In this case, the name of the Python file is "python_caesar_cipher.py". So, to run the program, you would open the terminal in VSCode and type "python python_caesar_cipher.py" (without the quotes) and press enter. The program will then run and you should see the output in the terminal.
